## Why did you...

### Choose lowercase for colors?
Despite in the tradition hexadecimal numbers were typed uppercase, having them lowercase makes them faster 
to type and to read (and they look better imho). By the way I think that the most important thing is to choose 
a case convention and stick to it. Linter is our friend in this task

### Choose SCSS syntax (Sassy CSS) over SASS syntax(Indented Syntax)?
From the [Sass documentation page](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax "Sass documentation page"): 
> (SCSS) With a few small exceptions, itâ€™s a superset of CSS, which means essentially all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well.

This means that you can quickly do experiments with your css copying and pasting it from other places (Stackoverflow 
for example ðŸ™ƒ) without having to adjust the syntax
